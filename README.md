HOW DO I INTERPRET USER NEEDS AND IMPLEMENT THEM INTO A PROGRAM? HOW DOES CREATING "USER STORIES HELP WITH THIS?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to inteprt the needs I would have to start with system analysis. This would be the feedback from the users, called their user stories. Having the user stories
allows me to analyze the design and what the users are looking for. A user story is a great way to express user needs. It can help understand the perspective of the 
end-user. It also helps in understanding what the user wants and then create a simple requirement description for it. Then I would take this information and 
outputting the program.
